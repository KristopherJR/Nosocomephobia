# Nosocomephobia
Nosocomephobia is a 2D top-down survival horror game written in C# using the MonoGame framework. It utilizes the engine previously developed for COMP2451 and serves as the submission artefact for my final year Advanced Game Design &amp; Development module.

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
It’s 1834 and it’s been two years since the institution was legally pardoned, allowing the anatomisation of unclaimed paupers and deceased prisoners, much to public rebuke. Medically beneficial yet ethically questionable, it’s not long before rumour circulates that there’s more going on than simple biological study.  The Player (An Investigative Journalist) finds themselves in the now-abandoned infirmary searching for compelling evidence of wrongdoings relating to the alleged medical experiments on human cadavers. Unsettled and with extremely limited vision due to the imposing darkness, you cautiously navigate the begrimed infirmary in search of the Artefacts. Regretting your decision to enter, you know your only way out is by going further in. You stop dead in your tracks, paralyzed by fear as the silence of the halls is shattered – you could feel and smell something was wrong and now you can hear it… You’re only praying you don’t see it. Frantically darting in the dark you search for the Artefacts - Find them, unlock the door, and get out, before it gets you.
